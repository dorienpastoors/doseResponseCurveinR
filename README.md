tutorial on how to get a dose response curve in R and read data from 96-well format

data for dose-resonse curves is often collected from 96 well plates and analysed by copy-pasting from excel to excel to prism... There is a lot of room for error there!
Importing them directly from excel files into R, especially with a lot of files, might be very useful in that case. 

Here's how!

Download the .zip file to get all required files. The contents of the zip file are also added as folders so you can see what's inside already.
